# Universal-Infrared-ATmega328p-remote
This project, that I and my colleague Ahmed Hayat have created, aims to program an microcontroller, specifically the Arduino ATmega328p, to receive and send infrared signals of a remote control.

As the short description already implies, we used a microcontroller and decided on one specific transmission protocol, namely the NEC transmission protocol, in which most TV remotes are encoded and decoded in a 38kHz frequency.

At the time when we finished the project, we had no knowledge about Git so the protocol or README comes in form of a word document.
